#Why I am fascinated in machin learning


Machine Learning is always a fascinating topic for me. At college, I took many probality and statistics classes. As a person with disability, I always see ML as a big opportunity to alleviate the struggling life of a physically disabled person. ML can extend to any type of disability. But particularly for me, I like to use ML for automated door opened for disabled people, better sensor and service for people with disability and smart ladder and elevator for people who use wheelchair for public transportation. Maybe, ML has more application than I can imagine, but my vision always focus on how to apply ML to better serve the disabled people.
